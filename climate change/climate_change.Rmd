## overview
There have been many studies documenting that the average global temperature has been increasing over the last century. The consequences of a continued rise in global temperature will be dire. Rising sea levels and an increased frequency of extreme weather events will affect billions of people.

In this problem, we will attempt to study the relationship between average global temperature and several other factors.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### 0: Load the data in RStudio
```{r}
climate = read_csv("data/climate_change.csv")

str(climate)

```

##divide data 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#train data till 2006
climate_train = climate %>% 
  filter(Year <= 2006)
# rename CFC.11 & CFC.12
colnames(climate_train)[7] <- 'CFC_11'
colnames(climate_train)[8] <- 'CFC_12'
summary(climate_train)

#test data the remainder
climate_test = climate %>% 
  filter(Year > 2006)

```

##  Build a linear regression model
build a linear regression model to predict the dependent variable Temp, using MEI, CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC.11, CFC.12, TSI, and Aerosols as independent variables (Year and Month should NOT be used in the model).
```{r}

temp_model = lm(Temp ~ MEI + CO2 + CH4 + N2O + CFC_11 + CFC_12 + TSI + Aerosols, data = climate_train)
summary(temp_model)
```
## train data correlation
```{r}
cor(climate_train)
```

## simpler model
Given that the correlations are so high, let us focus on the N2O variable and build a model with only MEI, TSI, Aerosols and N2O as independent variables. Remember to use the training set to build the model.

```{r}
temp_model2 = lm(Temp ~ MEI + N2O + TSI + Aerosols, data = climate_train)
summary(temp_model2)
```
