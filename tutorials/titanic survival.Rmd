## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load data
train <- read.csv('data/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('data/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
# bind training & test data
full  <- bind_rows(train, test) 

# check data
str(full)
```

## Feature engineering
Get the passengers titles & surnames
```{r}
# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)

# Show title counts by sex
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')

# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
full$Title[full$Title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
full$Title[full$Title %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'

# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
full$Surname <- sapply(full$Name,  
                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])
cat(paste('We have ', nlevels(factor(full$Surname)), ' unique surnames. I would be interested to infer ethnicity based on surname --- another time.'))
```
First we’re going to make a family size variable based on number of siblings/spouse(s) (maybe someone has more than one spouse?) and number of children/parents.
```{r}
# Create a family size variable including the passenger themselves
full$Fsize <- full$SibSp + full$Parch + 1

# Create a family variable 
full$Family <- paste(full$Surname, full$Fsize, sep='_')

head(full$Family)
# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between family size & survival
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(x = Fsize, fill = factor(Survived))) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Family size") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:11)) + 
  theme_few()
```
Collapse this variable into three levels which will be helpful since there are comparatively fewer large families
```{r}
# Discretize family size
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize == 1] <- 'singleton'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize < 5 & full$Fsize > 1] <- 'small'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize > 4] <- 'large'

# Show family size by survival using a mosaic plot
mosaicplot(table(full$FsizeD, full$Survived), main='Family Size by Survival', shade=TRUE)

```

```{r}
# This variable appears to have a lot of missing values
full$Cabin[1:28]
# The first character is the deck. For example:
length(strsplit(full$Cabin[28], " ")[[1]])
# Create a Deck variable. Get passenger deck A - F:
full$Deck<-factor(sapply(full$Cabin, function(x) strsplit(x, "")[[1]][1]))
### extra
# Get cabins with multiple rooms
full$Cabin[sapply(full$Cabin, function(x) length(strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]))>1]
# plot the relation between multiple rooms cabin and survival
 full %>% 
  filter(sapply(full$Cabin, function(x) length(strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]))>1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Cabin, fill = Survived)) + 
   geom_histogram(stat = "count") + 
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
#Missingness
Missing Embarked
```{r}
###extra
#check missing values
table(full$Embarked)
#get ids of missing values
full$PassengerId[full$Embarked==""]
###
# Passengers 62 and 830 are missing Embarkment
full[c(62, 830), 'Embarked']
cat(paste('We will infer their values for **embarkment** based on present data that we can imagine may be relevant: **passenger class** and **fare**. We see that they paid<b> $', full[c(62, 830), 'Fare'][[1]][1], '</b>and<b> $', full[c(62, 830), 'Fare'][[1]][2], '</b>respectively and their classes are<b>', full[c(62, 830), 'Pclass'][[1]][1], '</b>and<b>', full[c(62, 830), 'Pclass'][[1]][2], '</b>. So from where did they embark?'))

# Get rid of our missing passenger IDs
embark_fare <- full %>%
  filter(PassengerId != 62 & PassengerId != 830)
# Use ggplot2 to visualize embarkment, passenger class, & median fare
ggplot(embark_fare, aes(x = Embarked, y = Fare, fill = factor(Pclass))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # as passenger 62 paid fare $80
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=80), colour='red', linetype='dashed', lwd=2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) + 
  theme_few()


# Since their fare was $80 for 1st class, they most likely embarked from 'C'
full$Embarked[c(62, 830)] <- 'C'
```

Missing fare
```{r}
#get observation with NA fare
full[is.na(full$Fare),]
#visualize Fares among all others sharing their class and embarkment (n = 494).
ggplot(full[full$Pclass == '3' & full$Embarked == 'S', ], aes(x = Fare)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "#0034dd", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(Fare, na.rm=T)), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed", lwd=1) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar)
  theme_few()
  # Replace missing fare value with median fare for class/embarkment
full$Fare[is.na(full$Fare)] <- median(full[full$Pclass == '3' & full$Embarked == 'S', ]$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Missing age predication
```{r}
# Show number of missing Age values
sum(is.na(full$Age))
# Make variables factors into factors
factor_vars <- c('PassengerId','Pclass','Sex','Embarked',
                 'Title','Surname','Family','FsizeD')

full[factor_vars] <- lapply(full[factor_vars], function(x) as.factor(x))

# Set a random seed
set.seed(129)

# Perform mice imputation, excluding certain less-than-useful variables:
mice_mod <- mice(full[, !names(full) %in% c('PassengerId','Name','Ticket','Cabin','Family','Surname','Survived')], method='rf') 

# Save the complete output 
mice_output <- complete(mice_mod)

# Plot age distributions
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(full$Age, freq=F, main='Age: Original Data', 
  col='darkgreen', ylim=c(0,0.04))
hist(mice_output$Age, freq=F, main='Age: MICE Output', 
  col='lightgreen', ylim=c(0,0.04))

# Replace Age variable from the mice model.
full$Age <- mice_output$Age

# Show new number of missing Age values
sum(is.na(full$Age))
```
create a couple of new age-dependent variables: Child and Mother. A child will simply be someone under 18 years of age and a mother is a passenger who is 1) female, 2) is over 18, 3) has more than 0 children (no kidding!), and 4) does not have the title ‘Miss’.

```{r}
# First we'll look at the relationship between age & survival
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(Age, fill = factor(Survived))) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  # I include Sex since we know (a priori) it's a significant predictor
  facet_grid(.~Sex) + 
  theme_few()

# Create the column child, and indicate whether child or adult
full$Child[full$Age < 18] <- 'Child'
full$Child[full$Age >= 18] <- 'Adult'

# Show counts
table(full$Child, full$Survived)

# Adding Mother variable
full$Mother <- 'Not Mother'
full$Mother[full$Sex == 'female' & full$Parch > 0 & full$Age > 18 & full$Title != 'Miss'] <- 'Mother'

# Show counts
table(full$Mother, full$Survived)

# Finish by factorizing our two new factor variables
full$Child  <- factor(full$Child)
full$Mother <- factor(full$Mother)

#check for missing data
md.pattern(full)
```
#Prediction
At last we’re ready to predict who survives among passengers of the Titanic based on variables that we carefully curated and treated for missing values. For this, we will rely on the randomForest classification algorithm; we spent all that time on imputation, after all.

 Split into training & test sets
```{r}
# Split the data back into a train set and a test set
train <- full[1:891,]
test <- full[892:1309,]

```

Building the model
```{r}
# Set a random seed
set.seed(754)

# Build the model (note: not all possible variables are used)
rf_model <- randomForest(factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + 
                                            Fare + Embarked + Title + 
                                            FsizeD + Child + Mother,
                                            data = train)

# Show model error
#The black line shows the overall error rate which falls below 20%. The red and green lines show the error rate for #‘died’ and ‘survived’ respectively. We can see that right now we’re much more successful predicting death than we #are survival. What does that say about me, I wonder?
plot(rf_model, ylim=c(0,0.36))
legend('topright', colnames(rf_model$err.rate), col=1:3, fill=1:3)

```
Variable importance
Let’s look at relative variable importance by plotting the mean decrease in Gini calculated across all trees.

```{r}
# Get importance
importance    <- importance(rf_model)
varImportance <- data.frame(Variables = row.names(importance), 
                            Importance = round(importance[ ,'MeanDecreaseGini'],2))

# Create a rank variable based on importance
rankImportance <- varImportance %>%
  mutate(Rank = paste0('#',dense_rank(desc(Importance))))

# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relative importance of variables
ggplot(rankImportance, aes(x = reorder(Variables, Importance), 
    y = Importance, fill = Importance)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  geom_text(aes(x = Variables, y = 0.5, label = Rank),
    hjust=0, vjust=0.55, size = 4, colour = 'red') +
  labs(x = 'Variables') +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_few()
```

Prediction!
We’re ready for the final step — making our prediction! When we finish here, we could iterate through the preceding steps making tweaks as we go or fit the data using different models or use different combinations of variables to achieve better predictions. 


```{r}
# Predict using the test set
prediction <- predict(rf_model, test)

# Save the solution to a dataframe with two columns: PassengerId and Survived (prediction)
solution <- data.frame(PassengerID = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)

# Write the solution to file
write.csv(solution, file = 'data/rf_mod_Solution.csv', row.names = F)
```
